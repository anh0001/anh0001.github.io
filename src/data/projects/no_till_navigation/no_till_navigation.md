The system architecture draws inspiration from how the human brain integrates various sensory inputs to navigate complex environments. By combining:

1. **RGB Visual Pathway**: Processes color and texture information about crops and terrain
2. **Depth Perception Pathway**: Analyzes terrain variations and obstacles
3. **LiDAR Point Cloud Pathway**: Provides precise spatial mapping for navigation planning

These pathways converge in an attention-based fusion module that weighs the importance of each input modality based on environmental conditions.
