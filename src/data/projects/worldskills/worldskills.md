## Project Overview
As Indonesia's recognized Expert in Mobile Robotics for WorldSkills competitions, I've led national teams to international recognition while advancing robotics education and technology implementation. My expertise spans mentoring competitors, designing competition strategies, and developing innovative robotic solutions for real-world challenges ranging from healthcare to agriculture. Through this role, I've bridged theoretical robotics knowledge with practical applications, positioning Indonesia as a competitive force in global robotics competitions.

## Key Contributions
- Represented Indonesia as the official Mobile Robotics Expert at WorldSkills Asia 2022, WorldSkills ASEAN Singapore 2023, and WorldSkills International Online Challenge 2021
- Developed comprehensive training programs for national competitors, focusing on advanced programming, mechanical design, and real-time problem-solving
- Created competition strategies that resulted in multiple medals, including Runner-Up at WorldSkills Asia 2022 and Gold Medal at WorldSkills ASEAN Singapore 2023
- Designed robotics challenges that simulate real-world scenarios in healthcare, manufacturing, and agriculture settings
- Established knowledge transfer protocols between international experts, enhancing Indonesia's robotics capabilities

## Robot Design Evolution

### First Design Iteration

*Figure 1: First Design Iteration based on National Selection/Indonesia Skills 2022 Rule - An early version of the robot designed for the Regional Selection, with an unrestricted count of sensors and motors.*

This design robot was used for Regional Selection 2022. The rule was adopted from the WSC Shanghai 2022 or WSC Bordeaux 2022 by Studica. All robot was designed using local parts and MyRIO and LabVIEW as controllers. There were no limitations on the number of sensors and motors.

### Second Design Iteration

</p>

*Figure 2: Second Design Iteration following National Selection/Indonesia Skills 2022 Rule - An evolved version focusing on single cube handling, emphasizing enhanced mobility through three omnidirectional wheels.*

This design robot was used for National Selection 2022. The rule was adopted from the WSC Shanghai 2022 or WSC Bordeaux 2022 by Studica. All robot was designed using local parts and MyRIO and LabVIEW as controllers. In the second design, we focused on taking and putting one object (cube). There were no limitations on the number of sensors and motors, but we used three omni wheels rather than four mecanum wheels for better maneuverability.

### Third Design Iteration

*Figure 3: Third Design Iteration following WorldSkills ASEAN 2023 rule - Adapted and refined design after the team's selection as a WorldSkills ASEAN 2023 candidate, explicitly focusing on manipulating multiple cubes.*

After our team was selected as a Candidate for WorldSkills ASEAN 2023, we changed the previous design according to the regulations. We focused on grabbing multiple cubes at once and designed the robot using a Studica kit for WorldSkills ASEAN 2023.

### Final Design
<p align="center"><img src="./images/projects/worldskills/picture4.webp" alt="Final Design"></p>

*Figure 4: Final (fourth) Design for the WorldSkills ASEAN 2023 Competition - This enhanced model includes a versatile gripper capable of handling both cubes and a gurney, part of the essential design adaptations for the international competition. Note that the robot is equipped with a magazine to hold multiple cubes.*

The final design represents a culmination of strategic evolutions incorporated over the previous designs, modified particularly to excel in medical supply delivery tasks within hospital environments. One of the most distinctive features is the innovative gripper mechanism that can handle multiple cubes simultaneously as well as maneuver gurneys. This design also incorporates a 'magazine'â€”a storage compartment that holds multiple cubes (up to three in the magazine and one in the gripper), enabling the robot to transport four cubes in a single trip.
